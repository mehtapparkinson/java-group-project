# Movie Tracker System

## Project Overview

The **Movie Tracker System** is a Spring Boot application designed to help users track their favorite movies.
It allows users to perform actions such as adding new movies, viewing their movie collection, and tracking details
about each movie (e.g., title, personal review of each film, personal rating and date added).

## Application Requirements

- The system allows users to manage a collection of movies.
- Users can add, view, update, and delete movies from their collection.
- Each movie will have attributes such as:
    - Title
    - Personal review
    - Date added
    - Rating 
- Data is stored in a MySQL database, and the application provides REST endpoints to interact with this data.
